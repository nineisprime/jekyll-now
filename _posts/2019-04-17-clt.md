#### Abstract:
This paper derives central limit and bootstrap theorems for probabilities
that sums of centered high-dimensional random vectors hit hyperrectangles
and sparsely convex sets. Specifically, we derive Gaussian and bootstrap approximations for probabilities P(n−1/2 n
i=1 Xi ∈ A) where X1,...,Xn are
independent random vectors in Rp and A is a hyperrectangle, or more generally, a sparsely convex set, and show that the approximation error converges
to zero even if p = pn → ∞ as n → ∞ and p  n; in particular, p can be
as large as O(eCnc) for some constants c,C > 0. The result holds uniformly
over all hyperrectangles, or more generally, sparsely convex sets, and does not
require any restriction on the correlation structure among coordinates of Xi.
Sparsely convex sets are sets that can be represented as intersections of many
convex sets whose indicator functions depend only on a small subset of their
arguments, with hyperrectangles being a special case.
