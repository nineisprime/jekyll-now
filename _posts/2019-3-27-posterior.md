### The Consistency of Posterior Distributions in Nonparametric Problems [AOS](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aos/1018031206)

#### Authors: Andrew Barron, Mark J. Schervish, Larry Wasserman

#### Abstract: We give conditions that guarantee that the posterior probability of
every Hellinger neighborhood of the true distribution tends to 1 almost
surely. The conditions are 1 a requirement that the prior not put high Ž .
mass near distributions with very rough densities and 2 a requirement Ž .
that the prior put positive mass in KullbackLeibler neighborhoods of the
true distribution. The results are based on the idea of approximating the
set of distributions with a finite-dimensional set of distributions with
sufficiently small Hellinger bracketing metric entropy. We apply the results to some examples.
