### Estimation and Inference of Heterogenous Treatment Effects Using Random Forest [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04342)
#### by Stefan Wager and Susan Athey

**Presenter:** Min Xu

**Presenter's Comments:**
This talk will introduce the problem of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation and touch on both the Wager and Athey paper as well as an earlier paper, _Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects_ [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01132). No prior knowledge in causal inference needed.
